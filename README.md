# Credit-Risk-Prediction
Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan.

I started this project filling out the missing values and started visualizing the given data to figure out any correlations between variables. 

Later, I utilized different learning algorithms including KNN, Logistic regression, decision tree, and the popular XGBoost to find the best algorithms, and on top of that, I also implemented RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to fine tune the hyperparamters and further improve the model.
